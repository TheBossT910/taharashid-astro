*AnimeTracker*
- Did some more stuff in Figma. Created the "calandar/schedule" mockup

<img src="/public/blog/koyomidevlogs/post-3/figma-high-fidelity.png" alt="figma high fidelity" style="max-height: 800px; width: auto">

- Started coding the schedule section of the anime app

- Uploaded to Github now! Xcode will now sync with the GitHub repo (I think lol)

Next time:
- Need to make a view with all shows in the schedule, and make it scrollable
- Find a way to add custom fonts
