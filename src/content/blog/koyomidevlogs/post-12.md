*AnimeTracker*

- Going to try to implement the favorites button fix first
    - Fix implemented, favorites button seems to be working correctly now
- With this fix, I have now fully implemented all of the .json file functions using Firebase!
- Now, I need to:
    1. Clean up the existing code
    2. Optimize easy stuff
- Okay, I've cleaned up a lot of the code (all in the AnimeTracker folder, and the FavoriteButtonFB file). I want to clean up other files/check them as well, so I am not finished with this yet! I "optimized" these views when I noticed the had duplicate variables and such, but didn't really optimize the app. This will come at a later stage hopefully.
- Plan is to:
    - Finish cleaning up ALL views (includes removing old AnimeData and .json files)
Start working again on the Categories? Make it actually work using Firebase instead of fake dummy variables
