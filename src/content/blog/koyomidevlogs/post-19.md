*AnimeTracker*

- Fixed most of the issues with "ScheduleAiring" stuff thankfully
- Took a while though :( but its fiiinnnneeeee
- I want to do some more testing, then clean up code and merge into main (hopefuly)
- On Notion, I have outlined plans for other branches/features I gotta do:
    - [ ] Implement checkmark system for watched/unwatched shows (with green = watched, orange = unwatched if they are shows you saved, and just black for unwatched if not saved show)
    - [ ] Implement icon path in files (Firebase)
    - [ ] Split broadcast (in general) to broadcast_day and broadcast_time
    - [ ] Optimized for iPad
    - [ ] AnimeList: Padding on left/right sides for animes
