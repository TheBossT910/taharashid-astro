*AnimeTracker*
- Finally finished exam, got home
- Started working on app again, working on getting Firebase to work properly
- Had downloaded gitkraken, started using it more now as well
- Took a lot of time, but I understand how Firebase works with Swift
- Properly implemented a good working way to access Firebase items into Swift/SwiftUI
- Currently now plan to research how Firestore works (so I can store the splash/box images, etc. into the cloud and retrieve them)
- Asked AI about monetization:

Next steps:
- Implement Firebase data into the main app, then merge the branch into main
- Research saving files into the cloud, Firestore?
