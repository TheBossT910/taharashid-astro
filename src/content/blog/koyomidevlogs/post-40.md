*AnimeTracker*

- Trying to implement schedule view lazy load
    - 2 cour: 164172
    - 1 cour: 176496
    - Check: if a show's first episode > date, ignore
    - If lastEpisode < currentDate, ignore

    - if firstEpisode <= currentDate <= lastEpisode, show whole show
    - If firstEpsiode <= currentDate and lastEpisode = nil, show the whole show
    - If both nil, ignore

- Problem I've noticed: because we do .sorted() for the keys in List and schedule row view, a show can stay perpetually at the bottom! (because it "sorts" to the bottom
    - FIXED! Use different array only storing keys
    - Implemented in Schedule row, still need to implement in List view
- I need to get the initial docs first (otherwise it crashes)
- I also need to check if those docs already exist in our local collection, and if the count <= 0 then run again

- Other problem: it runs like crazy when we are trying to filter out based on days
- Problem: it keeps crashing
    - I think what we want to do is add the animes we scrapped (which is what we are doing) but donâ€™t filter looking at them, filter looking at the direct output from what we just got
    - But we also want to check if what we have saved is applicable to our view (im just going to ignore this for now :( )

- PLAN: completely redo how we are tackling this
- Make a new fn that gets all animes of that day, and stores to array
- Then we simply just show that array (easy)
- And we can add to main data (since we already scraped for it)

- Okay, I've gotten dynamic weekdays to work, but there are a lot of hard-coded values
    - Change all hard-coded values to variables
    - Do further testing
    - Also, change the wording from "weekdays" to "weekday" i.e. Tuesdays to Tuesday. It makes everything easier (or do the opposite, change all Tuesday -> Tuesdays)

- I got dynamic loading to work! Its done!
- I also fixed some bugs
    - One I remember is that in the Lists view, stuff was randomly being shuffled around so we used our orderedKeys list instead!

- Next steps: in schedule view, we show the data only for episode 1 (this is hard-coded). Switch to show data for current episode!
