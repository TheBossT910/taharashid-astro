*AnimeTracker*

- Added a drop down to add/remove from watchlists
- Fixed some other small stuff
    - I made it so that for the Lists view, there is a placeholder image so everything scrolls smoothly, and I tried to make it preload more items than before
- I want to add a "favorites" toggle in the schedule section so that we can filter by our favorite shows (which is more useful)
    - Done!
    - I also fixed an issue where the views in schedule were bigger than the actual screen size, so everything was going off screen
- I added placeholder images for all major images (except in details view) so everything looks nice/normal when images do not load!

- Need to optimize DB, currently consulting ChatGPT on this (nvm its bad)
    - I think im going to just make the DB smaller for now
