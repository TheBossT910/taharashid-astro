*AnimeTracker*

- There was a problem with the Python API. Everytime it would restart, it would use the default values instead of database values
    - Fixed by just initially setting values to DB values
    - Also updated to make it update every day for currently airing shows
    - Made it get new shows every week
- I did LinkedIn Post and Instagram, and SOMEONE SIGNED UP!
