*AnimeTracker*

- Wow, its been almost 1 week since I worked on it :(
- Going to try fixing new style of menu :)
    - Made a new version in Figma (only Low-Res, but still looks good)
    - Implemented! Looks pretty clean

Problems:
- There is too much space between schedule items. Need to make smaller
- On ScheduleHome, all of the text is blue. Fix pls (been a bug for a while ðŸ˜­)
