*AnimeTracker*

- Just testing my changes, and for any other bugs to fix :)
- Fixed some issues and cleaned up my code. I now merged my schedules branch into main.
- I have created the styling branch, and will now work on that (check notion for todos)
- I am also researching ways to get/scrape/access data. Here is what ChatGPT + my own notes say:
    - AniList: https://docs.anilist.co/ THIS one is really good, I want to use this and figure out GraphQL
    - MAL: https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig
- Talking to ChatGPT about monitizaiton
    - Anime Conventions & Events: Partner with anime conventions or events to feature them in the app, allowing users to buy tickets directly through the app or get discounts for attending.
    - Brand Partnerships: Reach out to anime-related companies, such as anime apparel brands, figures, or fan art shops, and offer them a partnership for sponsored content. You could display their ads or special offers in the app.
    - Promote Indie Anime Projects: Work with independent anime creators or small studios to promote their work on your platform. You could offer paid placements or special events for them.
    - Anime Merch & Collectibles: Even if streaming services no longer offer affiliate links, you could still monetize through affiliate programs from online anime stores (e.g., Crunchyroll Store, Amazon, etc.) or niche anime merchandise sites. This could be integrated with user profiles so they can view and purchase items they like or see in their watchlists.
    - Direct Affiliate Deals with Merch Shops: You could establish direct affiliate deals with companies that sell anime figures, clothing, or other merchandise. Integrate product recommendations within the app based on the shows they watch.
