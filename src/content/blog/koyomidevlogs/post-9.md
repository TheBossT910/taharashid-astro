*AnimeTracker*
- Last day of the year!

Plan:
- [x] Import all sample data into Firebase (create data when needed)
    - [ ] Update Swift struct variable names to match updated Firebase field names (check Notion)
- [ ] Implement Firebase into AnimeTracker app
- [ ] Properly implement iPad compatability!
- [ ] Finish/fix schedule view
- [ ] ?Create a script to import data into Firebase (can be in any other language)
- [ ] ?MAL API research

*Throughout the rest of the break, I was continously testing/implementing Firebase into AnimeTracker, making changes when necessary. The biggest changes were getting favorites to (kinda) work. Now, I need to make them properly work, and use an @Environment for AnimeData.*
