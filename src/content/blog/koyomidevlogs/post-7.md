*AnimeTracker*
- Put the google api file in a gitignore, and pushed the changes to github
- Made a naming scheme document
- Trying to learn how to use firebase nicely; had AI help me with my code and teach me how to mess around with async functions in Swift (properly lol, spend 2-3 hours on this)
    - Now I properly understand, and have some working testing code!
