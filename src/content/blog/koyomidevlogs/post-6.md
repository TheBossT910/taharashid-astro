*AnimeTracker*
- The json I am using is getting chaotic; lets look at databases
- Decided on Firebase so far!
- Got a demo of it working in its own Swift file!
    - Need to make it work universally (replace the json version)
    - Need to import the json data into Firebase
- Note: Github said your Google API key was exposed. Which is true. But I said it was in testing, so it ignored it. Figure out a way to ignore uploading the Google file!
    - Put in some "gitignore" file????
