*SavePoint*

I just created this new Figma design

- I'm going to start work in React Native now

- I started the home screen in React Native and it looks pretty good so far
    - React Native is pretty good/easy to learn

- This is a screenshot of it actually running on MY phone
- I've learned that the web version works a little different, so donâ€™t worry about it right now but we will have to change a few things later (as this will be a mobile-first app)
