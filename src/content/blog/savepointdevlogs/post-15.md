*SavePoint*

- Today, I plan to work on NOT the POS screen, but figuring out how to layer views on top of each other
    - This way, we can compose more complex views and then create the POS screen as well (which heavily involves this)
- I learned how to overlay components, but did not implement it yet
- I created the "Retailers" section in the details view

- I also showed my uncle/talked to him, and he said it is good idea/standard practice to have a logo/name of your app somewhere in the app, and a top navigation bar
