*SavePoint*

- Yesterday (I think) I did a bit of analysis on IMDB and Steam's website
    - I kinda understand how to design my site to not look bland and be usable now!
- I've been slacking off. Its time we go FULL THROTLE and design all of the webpages we need
    - Then, we can start coding them in!
- I want to kind of ignore connecting the backend at the moment. I made it a while ago, and the database structure may not match what I want it to do.
- Looks pretty nice at the moment. Also created a theme for the site (see video, it was actually at July 19 since I stayed up late)
