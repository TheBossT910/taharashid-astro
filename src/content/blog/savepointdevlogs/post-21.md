*SavePoint*

- Man, its been a WHILE
- Basically, I've decided to abandomn the mobile-first idea and make it into a dynamic, reposnive website built on Nuxt and Vue (thanks to my good experiene with it at work)
- I made a LinkedIn post, its scheduled to come out at 1pm Monday (tomorrow)
- I also made a new Figma design for the website this weekend and I'm very happy with it so far. Its enough to start working on it again
- Here was my final React Native results (before cancelling it) and of my new Figma design
