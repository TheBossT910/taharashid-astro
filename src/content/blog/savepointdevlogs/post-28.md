*SavePoint*

- Continuing on home screen
- Trying to make a caresoul
    - I'm basing it off of Netflix (4 large, 3 md, 2 small)
- I think I will have to make a custom caresole

PLANS:
- Need to have selection centered (not on edge) when id is selected (JS?)
- Overflow-hidden for no scrollbar
- Need to dynamically add/remove items in slides based on screen size breakpoints
