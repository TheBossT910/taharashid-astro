*SavePoint*

- I completed the retailers section
    - Changed up the design a little bit. The Figma design was always a bit basic and lacking in my opinion
    - Now, I think it looks better. Plus,  I added dark mode and mobile compatibility!

- Here are the mobile (small viewport) layouts

- Now, I have to plan what other views we want, and need to start designing the business admin interface
