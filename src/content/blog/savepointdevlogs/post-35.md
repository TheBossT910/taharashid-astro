*SavePoint*

Views we will have in phase 1:
- Home (/home)
    - Splash screen
    - Recommended lists and trending lists
    - Has 'discover new games' built-in
    - Search is built-in on top navbar, which is persistent
- Games (/products)
    - See all games, consoles, categories
- Game details (/products/:id)
- Login/Account (/login, /account)
    - Login page, user account page w/ settings
- My collection (/account/collection)
    - User's collections
    - Has Wishlist

Potential future routes:
- Game guides, videos, forums (?): (/community)
- Stores (/stores)

I think I'll start designing (in order, in Figma):
- Games, My Collection, Login, Account
