*SavePoint*

- Today, I will begin to make the API in ExpressJS
- I accidently pushed the keys to GitHub, its whatever. I need to just reset the keys and I'll be fine
- Created the basic API, it gets all the data we want from IGDB and PriceCharting
- I will implement the search API tomorrow

IGDB API:
- Website: type 1 = official website
