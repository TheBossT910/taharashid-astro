*SavePoint*

- Canada Day, no work
- Trying to get custom button scrolling working
    - I got it working, now I will make it automatically generate via code instead of hardcoding it
- Moved the carousel into a separate component
- Here is the result so far

- I need to modify the shadow, make it very low and add a highlight around the card to make it pop (done)
- I also need to manually change the width of the product card when the viewport changes as well (done)
- I just made it work with dark mode as well

- Now, I'm going to add simple hover effects (over the clickable items)
    - Cards and buttons (done)
- I also added a tilt effect based on the position of the mouse on the cards! (with the help of AI)
