*SavePoint*

- It is Saturday. I just finished my first week at Oliver's Labels. Hooray!
- But now its time to work on the app
- I was able to make it so running /lists/popular checks if a game is in the db, and adds it if not. Then, it returns all of the popular games ad db objects
- The frontend I added a service and interface, and was able to interact with the backend for the first time!!!
