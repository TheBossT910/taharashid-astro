## It’s been a little over 2 weeks since my first year at uOttawa came to a close.

My first year at university has **honestly been amazing**. I’ve learned so much, made new friends, joined and worked with uOttawa Supermileage (a competitive electric car team) and the Software Engineering Student Association (SESA), got an internship at Oliver’s Labels, and even released my first app, Koyomi AnimeTracker. It’s been an amazing journey so far, and I hope to continue learning and growing throughout this summer and well into my 2nd year at uOttawa.

But if I’m making a post, I probably have more than just this to say, right?

Yes. And it’s a major announcement: **I’m working on a new app.**

- For **iOS/iPhones**.
- And for **Android**.
- And for **web**.
- Made for **users**.
- And *designed* for **businesses**.

It is a massive, new, ambitious **project** that I’ve been thinking about for years, and Koyomi AnimeTracker was **just the stepping stone**.
## And I’m calling this new project SavePoint.

**Savepoint** is planned to be a cross-platform app for tracking your video game collection (physical or digital).
For users, they will be able to easily and conveniently add and scan games (via barcodes), track, and catalogue their video games to expand their game collection! Users will be able to make informed purchasing decisions by seeing backwards compatibility and historical pricing data.

For stores and businesses, they will be able to quickly/easily track all of their game inventory through the app, set game prices by using our custom historical pricing service, automatically create SavePoint game listings and display ALL of their store inventory online by syncing their SavePoint listings to other marketplaces using our services. A convenient and easy way for businesses to take their local game store into the modern world and expand their customer base!
