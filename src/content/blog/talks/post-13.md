SavePoint’s design has been **finalized!** 🚀
I’ve created *7 completely new components* and updated *3 original designs* all with a new a blue and purple a color theme.
- Each component has a **dark blue shadow**, with **rounded corners**, **thin borders**, and an emphasis on a **game’s box art**. 🖼️
- Clickable buttons are coloured **purple**, while other static information is colored **blue**.
- Components are designed to be **simple**, **clean**, and **mobile-friendly**. 📱

My site has *3 main components*:
- *The products component*, designed to **quickly showcase a game’s art and name** .🎨

- *The video preview components*, featuring a game’s **box art** as well as a spot for a **video**. 🎥

- *The stack component*, designed to visually showcase **collections/lists** (such as a favorites list) visually, which just displays a **game’s box art** with multiple of these box arts *stack on top of each other like a playing card deck*. 🂡

The Home and Products page have been **updated** to feature these new components and theming, while I’ve also created all-new Lists and Inventory pages.
- Home displays filtering options and all *3 main components* (**products**, **video preview**, and **stacks**) 🏠

- The product details page displays a game’s **related information**, such as a **description**, **screenshots**, **videos**, **box art**, **reviews**, **platforms** (such as *Xbox, PS5, or Steam*), and a ‘**Retailers’** section (more below) 📋

- The ‘Retailers’ section within product details showcases a **list of stores** where you may **buy** that game (*Best Buy, eBay, a local game store, etc.*). It displays the **number of games** and in what **conditions** (*ex. 3 Excellent, 2 Poor, 5 New condition games*), and brings up a **map** with the store’s details *once clicked*. 🏬

- The lists page displays **lists**, like *‘Trending’, ‘Top Rated’, ‘Currently Played’, etc.* **including your own lists** such as *‘Favourites’*. Its designed to be a *simple view* that conveys **a lot of information** using a special ‘List’ component, which details a game’s **description**, **price**, and **platform** among other things. ❤️

- Inventory is **designed for businesses**. This is still a **work-in-progress**, as SavePoint V1 *isn’t* intended to have business-oriented features just yet. It is planned to display quick **shortcuts** to functions like ‘Add Inventory’ and ‘Scan SKU’, showcase ‘Recently Sold’ and ‘Hot Items’ among other lists, a **sales graph** with different selectable platforms to browse through, and a **list view** which would *display all inventory*.  📊

My current plan was to **create/update the designs** for SavePoint V1, **implement them** into the Nuxt frontend, then **connect the backend** to complete my site. I’m also considering *re-doing my backend in .NET*, but that’s **low priority**. **A launched site is better than no site!**

These design updates took me a **long time**, and now I’m **fully ready** to implement these into **SavePoint**!

What do *you* think of my updates? Let me know!
