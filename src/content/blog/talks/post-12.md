This week, I was updating all my socials and noticed my website, taharashid.ca looks a bit… **Bad**. 😅
So, I went ahead and redid it! 🚀

Initially, my website used a static site generator called *Hugo* with the *“Academic CV”* template. I did this so I could **quickly make a portfolio website** while I was still busy with other projects. ⏳

Now, I’ve changed the tech stack to **Astro** and **Vue**, while basing my website from a theme called *“Vitesse”*. ✨

The difference between the Hugo (old) and Astro (new) site is that I had *no idea how do code anything* in Hugo and was strictly using the template whereas with the Astro site, **I understand the codebase** and am just using the template as a starting point. 💡

I’ve even *already* heavily modified the template!
- I added **different sections** to the default blog page for my LinkedIn posts, Koyomi AnimeTracker devlogs, and SavePoint devlogs. 📝

- The experiences component (a component designed to display my work/personal projects and experiences) has been **completely redone** by adding **images**, **icons** for the technologies I’ve used, and a **hover effect**. 💻

- I added a **completely new page** called “Resume” which **displays my PDF resume** and has download/print icons. 🖨️

- Most importantly, the **home page has been redesigned** to display my **latest posts**, **latest experiences**, and my **GitHub contribution map** alongside a short blurb about me. 👋

I’m *very pleased* with my current portfolio website (which **shockingly** only took 3 days to remake), and I hope you’ll check it out too at taharashid.ca!

Let me know what you think. I’d love to hear feedback and see your websites as well!

Oh, and I haven’t forgotten about SavePoint at all. In fact, it’s the **biggest update since I changed tech stacks**. Below, I’ve linked a *sneak-peak* of my next post. 🔍👇
